# Technology Stack

## Cloud Platform
- **Azure**: Primary cloud platform for all infrastructure
- **Azure Resource Manager**: For resource provisioning and management
- **Azure Container Registry**: For Docker image storage

## Infrastructure
- **Terraform**: All infrastructure must be defined as code (v1.0+)
- **Docker**: Containerization standard for all applications
- **Azure Monitor**: Primary monitoring solution
- **Azure Key Vault**: Secret management

## CI/CD
- **GitHub**: Source code repository
- **GitHub Actions**: CI pipeline automation
- **Octopus Deploy**: CD orchestration
- **SonarQube**: Code quality scanning

## Development
- **VS Code**: Recommended IDE
- **Azure CLI**: For infrastructure management scripts

## Rules
1. All infrastructure changes must be made through Terraform
2. All applications must be containerized with Docker
3. All CI/CD pipelines must use GitHub Actions and Octopus Deploy
4. All secrets must be stored in Azure Key Vault
5. All monitoring must leverage Azure Monitor
