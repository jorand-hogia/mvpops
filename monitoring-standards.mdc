- **Custom Metrics**: For business-specific indicators
- **Collection Interval**: 1-minute intervals for critical metrics

## Logging Requirements
- **Log Analytics**: Central repository for all logs
- **Log Levels**: ERROR, WARN, INFO standardized across services
- **Structured Logging**: JSON format with standardized fields
- **Retention**: 30 days for standard logs, 1 year for security logs

## Alerting Framework
- **Alert Severity**: P1 (Critical), P2 (High), P3 (Medium), P4 (Low)
- **Response Times**: P1: 15min, P2: 1hr, P3: 4hrs, P4: 24hrs
- **Notification Channels**: Email, Teams, PagerDuty
- **Alert Suppression**: Quiet periods for maintenance windows

## Dashboards
- **Service Health**: Per-service dashboards
- **Business KPIs**: Key business metrics dashboards
- **Operations**: Infrastructure and platform dashboards
- **Refreshes**: Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

## Rules
1. All services must emit standard metrics for CPU, memory, and throughput
2. All applications must implement structured logging
3. All critical services must have defined alerts and SLOs
4. All teams must maintain service health dashboards
5. All production incidents must be traceable through logs
