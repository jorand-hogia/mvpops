# Technology Stack for Ops Platform

## Cloud Platform
- **Azure**: Primary cloud platform for all platform infrastructure
- **Azure Resource Manager**: For resource provisioning and management
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: Central Docker image repository

## Monitoring & Management
- **Azure Monitor**: Central monitoring solution for production environment
- **Log Analytics**: Central logging repository
- **Application Insights**: Application performance monitoring
- **Grafana**: Dashboard visualization layer on Azure data

## Infrastructure
- **Terraform**: All platform infrastructure defined as code (v1.0+)
- **Docker**: Containerization standard for all platform services
- **Azure Key Vault**: Centralized secret management
- **Azure Policy**: For governance enforcement

## CI/CD Infrastructure
- **GitHub**: Source code repository for infrastructure code
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline automation for platform components
- **SonarQube**: Central code quality scanning service

## Platform Services 
- **Azure Container Instances**: For ops platform tools
- **Virtual Network**: Hub-spoke network architecture
- **Azure Storage**: For platform artifacts and backups
- **Azure SQL**: For platform service databases

## Rules
1. All platform infrastructure must be defined as Terraform code
2. All platform services must be containerized with Docker
3. All platform CI/CD must use GitHub Actions
4. All platform secrets must be stored in Azure Key Vault
5. All platform components must emit monitoring data to Azure Monitor
