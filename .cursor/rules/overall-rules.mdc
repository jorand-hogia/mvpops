## Vision
To create a modern DevOps platform that enables rapid, high-quality software delivery with complete operational visibility through automation, standardization, and team autonomy.

## Goals
1. **Accelerate Delivery**: Enable product teams to reduce deployment lead time by 50%
2. **Increase Quality**: Provide tools to reduce production incidents by 40%
3. **Improve Visibility**: Achieve 100% visibility into production/staging environments
4. **Team Autonomy**: Enable teams to deploy independently with proper guardrails
5. **Operational Excellence**: Standardize infrastructure and operational practices



# Ops Platform Project Rules

This project focuses on building a centralized DevOps platform that product teams will connect to. The platform will provide:
- Centralized container registry and management
- Shared monitoring and observability infrastructure
- Common security scanning and compliance tools
- Self-service deployment capabilities
- Standardized infrastructure templates

This project follows specific conventions for:
- @tech-stack.mdc
- @code-conventions.mdc
- @architecture.mdc
- @deployment-standards.mdc
- @monitoring-standards.mdc
- @security-policies.mdc
- @team-workflows.mdc
- @naming-conventions.mdc

Key architectural principle: The platform provides central services that product teams consume via standardized APIs and interfaces.


tech-stack.mdc: Technologies, frameworks, and libraries used
code-conventions.mdc: Naming, formatting, and structural patterns
