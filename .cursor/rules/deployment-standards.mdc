# Ops Platform Deployment Standards

## Platform CI Pipeline
- **Source Control**: GitHub for all platform code
- **Branch Protection**: Required reviews for main branch
- **Build Automation**: GitHub Actions for platform components
- **Testing**: Automated unit, integration, and infrastructure tests
- **Artifact Publication**: Azure Container Registry for platform images

## Platform CD Pipeline
- **Deployment Tool**: Octopus Deploy for platform components
- **Environment Progression**: Dev → Staging → Production
- **Approval Process**: Automated for Dev, manual for Production
- **Rollback Capability**: All platform deployments must support rollback

## Platform Release Management
- **Release Cadence**: Bi-weekly platform updates
- **Change Records**: All platform changes documented
- **Change Windows**: Platform updates during defined maintenance windows
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning for platform components

## Platform Deployment Patterns
- **Blue/Green**: For zero-downtime platform upgrades
- **Infrastructure**: Apply infrastructure changes before service changes
- **Validation**: Automated post-deployment validation
- **Incremental**: Staged rollout for critical platform components

## Platform Templates
- **Product Onboarding**: Templates for product team onboarding
- **Environment Creation**: Standardized environment creation process
- **Resource Provisioning**: Self-service resource provisioning templates
- **Pipeline Templates**: Reusable CI/CD templates for product teams

## Rules
1. All platform code changes must pass automated tests before deployment
2. All platform production deployments must have manual approval
3. All platform deployments must have a documented rollback plan
4. All platform changes must be tracked in change management
5. All platform component versions must follow semantic versioning
