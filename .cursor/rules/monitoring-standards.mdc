# Ops Platform Monitoring Standards

## Platform Metrics Collection
- **Core Platform**: Azure Monitor for all platform metrics
- **Platform Health**: Uptime and availability monitoring
- **Resource Metrics**: CPU, memory, network for platform components
- **Custom Metrics**: Performance indicators for platform services
- **Collection Frequency**: 1-minute intervals for critical metrics

## Platform Logging Framework
- **Central Repository**: Log Analytics workspace for all platform logs
- **Log Levels**: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG standardized across platform
- **Structured Logging**: JSON format with standard fields
- **Log Correlation**: Distributed tracing IDs across platform components
- **Retention**: 30 days for operational logs, 1 year for security logs

## Platform Alerting System
- **Alert Tiers**: P1 (Critical), P2 (High), P3 (Medium), P4 (Low)
- **SLAs**: P1: 15min, P2: 1hr, P3: 4hrs, P4: 24hrs
- **Notifications**: Teams, Email, SMS based on severity
- **Routing**: Alert routing to appropriate platform teams
- **Suppression**: Maintenance window alert suppression

## Platform Dashboards
- **Platform Health**: Overall platform status dashboard
- **Component Status**: Individual component health dashboards
- **Resource Utilization**: Platform resource consumption dashboards
- **Cost Monitoring**: Platform cost tracking dashboards
- **Product Overview**: Multi-tenant product health overview

## Product Team Monitoring 
- **Self-Service**: Product teams can create custom dashboards
- **Onboarding**: Automated monitoring onboarding for products
- **Quotas**: Resource allocation for product monitoring
- **Integration**: Product-specific metrics integration
- **Isolation**: Cross-product monitoring data isolation

## Rules
1. All platform services must emit standard health metrics
2. All platform components must integrate with central logging
3. All critical platform services must have defined alerts and SLOs
4. All platform incidents must have associated metrics for post-mortem
5. All platform monitoring data must be retained according to retention policy
