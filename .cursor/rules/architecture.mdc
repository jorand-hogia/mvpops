# Ops Platform Architecture Standards

## Platform Environment Structure
- **Subscription Organization**: Dedicated subscription for ops platform
- **Resource Groups**: Organized by platform component type
- **Tagging**: All platform resources must have owner, cost-center, and application tags

## Platform Network Architecture
- **VNet Design**: Hub-and-spoke network topology, platform in hub
- **Peering**: Product environments connect via VNet peering
- **Subnets**: Segregated by platform function (registry, monitoring, security)
- **NSGs**: Defined at subnet level with principle of least privilege

## Platform Service Architecture
- **Containerization**: All platform services deployed as Docker containers
- **Service Discovery**: Azure DNS for internal service discovery
- **State Management**: Stateless services with state in managed services
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling configured for platform components

## Platform Integration Architecture
- **API Gateway**: Central entry point for platform APIs
- **Event Bus**: Azure Event Grid for platform notifications
- **Webhooks**: Standardized webhook format for integrations
- **Authentication**: Unified authentication for platform access

## Data Architecture
- **Metrics Storage**: Azure Monitor for metrics
- **Log Storage**: Log Analytics for centralized logs
- **Artifact Storage**: Azure Blob Storage for platform artifacts
- **Backup Storage**: Geo-redundant storage for platform backups

## Rules
1. All platform components must follow the defined environment structure
2. All platform services must connect through the hub-spoke network model
3. All platform services must be designed for high availability
4. All platform state must be stored in managed Azure services
5. All platform components must be documented in architecture diagrams
