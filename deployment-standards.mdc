# Deployment Standards

## CI Pipeline Requirements
- **Source Control**: GitHub for all code
- **Build Automation**: GitHub Actions
- **Testing**: Automated unit, integration, and security tests
- **Artifact Storage**: Azure Container Registry for Docker images

## CD Pipeline Requirements
- **Deployment Tool**: Octopus Deploy
- **Environment Progression**: Dev → Staging → Production
- **Approval Process**: Automated approvals for Dev, manual for Production
- **Rollback Plan**: All deployments must have defined rollback procedures

## Release Cadence
- **Development**: Continuous deployment
- **Staging**: Daily deployments 
- **Production**: Weekly deployments in defined windows

## Deployment Patterns
- **Blue/Green**: For zero-downtime deployments
- **Canary**: For high-risk changes
- **Feature Flags**: For incremental feature rollout

## Rules
1. All code changes must pass automated tests before deployment
2. All production deployments must have manual approval
3. All deployments must have a documented rollback plan
4. All high-risk changes must use canary deployment pattern
5. All deployments must be traceable to source code commits
