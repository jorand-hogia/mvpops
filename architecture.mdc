# Architecture Standards

## Azure Environment Structure
- **Subscription Organization**: One subscription per environment (dev/staging/prod)
- **Resource Groups**: Organized by service and environment
- **Tagging**: All resources must have owner, cost-center, and application tags

## Network Architecture
- **VNet Design**: Hub-and-spoke network topology
- **Subnets**: Segregated by function (app, data, management)
- **NSGs**: Defined at subnet level with principle of least privilege

## Application Architecture
- **Containerization**: All applications deployed as Docker containers
- **Service Discovery**: Azure-native service discovery
- **State Management**: Stateless services preferred, state in managed services

## Data Architecture
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage for unstructured data
- **Databases**: Azure SQL for relational, Cosmos DB for NoSQL
- **Caching**: Azure Redis Cache for performance optimization

## Rules
1. All systems must follow the defined Azure environment structure
2. All network connections must adhere to the least-privilege principle
3. All applications must be designed for high availability
4. All state must be stored in managed Azure services
5. All system components must be defined in architecture diagrams
